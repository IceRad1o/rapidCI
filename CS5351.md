### For Software Engineer Course project

**Aim**: implementing new software engineering tools. A software engineering tool is a tool for developers to assist them to carry out their daily technical tasks.

* Better to start with an operable open-source project.

* The best kind is a tool related to a research work so that you can read the paper
  about the key technique implemented in the tool

**Final Deliverable**: 

1. a 15-minute Video(due on 18November) 
2. An 15-minute oral presentation in week12-13 
3. a Final report- Around 10000 words.   : (

As far as i'm concerned, a project Need following parts:

- Scrum process
- MCR with github(Modern Code Review)
- Testing: TDD / Code coverage 

#### Lec1- Software Engineering Process

The Process is set of **activities,techniques,deliverables,tools** . Engineers follow practice like **agile method** to use these items to manager.

**Activities** for example : Collect user requirements -> Design software -> Coding -> testing -> Deploy(CI/CD with Jenkins) -> Maintain 

For activities ,we aslo have **tech** for each activity and for tech, it should produce **deliverables** to track the process.

#### Lec2- Modern Code Review

Follow MCR Practices(use github for tracking tools, make comments about code)

#### Lec3- Testing(Fuzzing and Scientific Debugging)

#### Lec4- Testing(Test Case Generation and Oracle)

#### Lec5- Code with Quality
